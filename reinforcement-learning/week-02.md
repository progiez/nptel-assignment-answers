**Q1.** **Which of the following is true of the UCB algorithm?**\
a) The action with the highest Q value is chosen at every iteration.\
b) After a very large number of iterations, the confidence intervals of unselected actions will not change much.\
c) The true expected-value of an action always lies within its estimated confidence interval.\
d) With a small probability ε, we select a random action to ensure adequate exploration of the action space.

**Q6.** **Which of the following statements is NOT true about Thompson Sampling?**\
a) After each sample is drawn, the q\* distribution for that sampled arm is updated to be closer to the true distribution.\
