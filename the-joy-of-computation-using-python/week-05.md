B. In the presence of duplicate elements in a list, binary search may or may not find the first occurrence of the element in the list

C. In the presence of duplicate elements in a list, the existing binary search algorithm with minor modifications can be used to find the first occurrence of the target element in the list\
D. In the presence of duplicate elements in a list , the existing binary search can be used to find any kth(k can be any number from 1 to number of times the element has been repeated) of target element in the list

**Answer: B, C**

# Programming Assignment

**Question 1**

**Write a function insert that accepts a sorted list L of integers and an integer x as input. The function should return a sorted list with the element x inserted at the right place in the input list. The original list should not be disturbed in the process.**

1. **The only built-in methods you are allowed to use are append and remove. You should not use any other method provided for lists.**
2. **You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.**

**Solution:**

    def insert(L, x):
        """
        insert an element x into a sorted list L

<!---->

        Arguments:
            L: list
            x: integers
        Return:
            sorted_L: list
        """
        M=L[::]
        M.append(x)
        return(sorted(M))

**Question 2**

**Accept a sequence of words as input. Create a dictionary named real\_dict whose keys are the letters of the English alphabet. For each key (letter), the corresponding value should be a list of words that begin with this key (letter). For any given key, the words should be appended to the corresponding list in the order in which they appear in the sequence. You can assume that all words of the sequence will be in lower case.\
You do not have to print the output to the console.**

**Solution:**

    words=input().split(",")
    #print("words is ",words)
    real_dict={}
    k=list("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
    for w in words:
      if w[0] not in real_dict:
        real_dict[w[0]]=[w]
      else:
        real_dict[w[0]].append(w)

**Question 3**

**Consider a grid-world of size n×n. You are at the bottom-left corner, at the cell (1,1), to start with. A sample grid-world for the case of n=5 is given below for your reference:**

**You can move one step at a time in any one of the four directions: “North”, “East”, “West”, “South”. At every cell of the grid, all four moves are possible. The only catch is that if you make a move that will take you out of the grid at a border cell, you will stay put at the same cell. Concretely, if you are at the cell (1,4) and try to move west, you will remain at the same cell. Or if you are at (3,1) and try to move south, you will remain there.**

**Write a function named final that accepts a positive integer _**n**_ and a sequence of moves (string) as arguments and returns the final position where you would end up in an _**n**_×_**n**_ grid-world if you start at (1,1). You must return a tuple of size 2, where the first element is the x-coordinate and the second is the y-coordinate.\
You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.**

**Solution:**

    def final(n, moves):
        x, y = 1, 1  # Starting position at (1,1)
        for move in moves:
            if move == "N" and y < n:
                y += 1
            elif move == "E" and x < n:
                x += 1
            elif move == "S" and y > 1:
                y -= 1
            elif move == "W" and x > 1:
                x -= 1
        return (x, y)
