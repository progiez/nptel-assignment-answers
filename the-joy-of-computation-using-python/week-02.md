## The Joy of Computing Using Python Week 2 Nptel Answers(Jan-Apr 2026)

**Que.1**\
How many times does the outer loop execute?

a) 4\
b) 5\
c) 6\
d) Depends on the inner loop

[View Answer](https://my.progiez.com/courses/the-joy-of-computing-using-python-answers/)

***

**Que.2**\
Why does Ravi’s code print each number on a new line instead of the same line?

a) Because `print()` moves the cursor to the next line by default\
b) Because `range()` creates new lines\
c) Because the inner loop executes first\
d) Because nested loops cannot print patterns

[View Answer](https://my.progiez.com/courses/the-joy-of-computing-using-python-answers/)

***

**Que.3**\
Ravi’s program executes without errors but fails to produce the required pattern. Which of the following best explains the cause?

a) The outer loop does not include the final value required for printing the last line\
b) The inner loop variable is declared but not explicitly used in the print statement\
c) The print statement is placed inside the inner loop instead of after it\
d) The inner loop executes one fewer iteration than required for each value of `i`

[View Answer](https://my.progiez.com/courses/the-joy-of-computing-using-python-answers/)

***

**Que.4**\
After correcting the inner loop to execute the required number of times, Ravi observes that the digits are still printed on separate lines. Which change is necessary to ensure that each digit appears on the same line before moving to the next line?

a) Replace `print(i)` with `print()` inside the inner loop\
b) Move the `print(i)` statement outside the inner loop\
c) Add an empty `print()` statement at the beginning of the outer loop\
d) Modify the `print` statement to suppress the default newline character

[View Answer](https://my.progiez.com/courses/the-joy-of-computing-using-python-answers/)

***

**Que.5**\
In the corrected nested-loop program, why is an additional `print()` statement required immediately after the inner loop completes?

a) To move the cursor to the next line after printing all digits for the current value of `i`\
b) To reset the value of the loop variable before the next iteration begins\
c) To ensure the inner loop terminates before the outer loop continues\
d) To prevent the digits printed in different iterations from overlapping
