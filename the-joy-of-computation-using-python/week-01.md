## The Joy of Computing Using Python Week 1 Nptel Answers (July-Dec 2025)

***

**Questions 1-7:\
Pixel the Cat’s Mysterious Journey**

In the vibrant digital world of Scratchville, lives a clever little cat named Pixel who loves exploring new areas through coding adventures. One day, Pixel stumbles upon a glowing scroll in the Scratch Coding Club’s lab. The scroll contains a strange pattern — a set of step-by-step movement instructions. Curious and excited, Pixel decides to follow them precisely.

Each instruction tells her to move a certain number of steps, wait patiently, and then rotate before continuing. The sequence seems repetitive, but Pixel senses that there’s a hidden purpose — maybe a message, a path, or a challenge.

As Pixel begins her journey, students at the club gather around the screen, watching the curious pattern unfold. Where will she end up? What shape will her path take? Why these specific turns and pauses?

Now, it’s up to you to analyze Pixel’s code-driven adventure and figure out the mysteries it holds… \
