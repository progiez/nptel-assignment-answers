Que. 2 Assertion (A): If a recursive function doesn’t have a base case, it may never stop.\
Reason (R): Recursion means that a function calls itself.

a) Both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).\
b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).\
c) (A) is true, but (R) is false.\
d) (A) is false, but (R) is true.

Que. 4 In English, the letter ‘z’ usually appears far less often than most letters. Now imagine applying a Substitution Cipher to a large body of English text, where ‘z’ is replaced by ‘r’, and every other letter is also mapped to a unique letter. After encryption, which letter is likely to be the least frequent in the new text?

a) z\
b) r\
c) e\
d) It is not possible to determine

Que. 6 Suppose you suspect that a piece of ciphertext was produced using a simple substitution cipher. Under which circumstances might frequency analysis fail to yield accurate results?

Que. 8 Assertion (A): A Caesar Cipher is a type of Substitution Cipher.\
Reason (R): In a Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter at a fixed shift in the alphabet.

a) Both (A) and (R) are true, and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).\
b) Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).\
c) (A) is true, but (R) is false.\
d) (A) is false, but (R) is true.

Que. 9 Which outcome generally follows from providing a proper base case in a recursive function?

a) The function returns a predefined result when the base condition is met.\
b) It prevents infinite recursion and stops when a specific condition is met.\
c) It ensures recursion depth is always constant.\
