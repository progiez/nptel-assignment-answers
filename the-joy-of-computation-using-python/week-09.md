### Programming Assignment

**Question 1**

**word is a string that contains one or more parentheses of the following types: “{ }”, “\[ ]”, “( )”. The string is said to be balanced if all the following conditions are satisfied.\
When read from left to right:\
(1) The number of opening parentheses of a given type is equal to the number of closing parentheses of the same type.\
(2) An opening parenthesis cannot be immediately followed by a closing parenthesis of a different type.\
(3) Every opening parenthesis should be eventually closed by a closing parenthesis of the same type.**

**Solution:**

    def balanced(word):
        stack = list()
        opening = "([{"
        closing = ")]}"
        mapping = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
        
        for char in word:
            if char in opening:
                stack.append(char)
            elif char in closing:
                if not stack or stack.pop() != mapping[char]:
                    return(not True)
        
        return(not stack)

**Question 2**

**Consider the problem about balanced expressions discussed in 1. Programming Assignment | Week 9. We have a balanced expression (string) that has only the flower brackets: ‘( )’. We can recursively define a concept called nesting depth for each pair of opening and closing brackets.\
The nesting depth of a pair that lies within another pair is one more than the nesting depth of the pair that immediately englobes it. For a pair that is not surrounded by any other pair, the nesting depth is 1.**

**Solution:**

    def depth(expr):
      max_deep = 0
      current_deep= 0
      for char in expr:
        if char == '(':
          current_deep += 1
          max_deep = max(max_deep, current_deep)
        elif char == ')':
          current_deep -= 1
      return(max_deep)

**Question 3**

**Write a recursive function named power that accepts a square matrix A and a positive integer m as arguments and returns A<sup>**m**</sup>.**

**Solution:**

    def power(A, m):
        if m == 0:
            ap = len(A)
            return [[1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(ap)]
        elif m == 1:
            return A
        else:
            G = power(A, m // 2)
            if m % 2 == 0:
                return matrix_multiply(G, G)
            else:
                return matrix_multiply(matrix_multiply(G, G), A)

    def matrix_multiply(A, B):
        rows_A = len(A)
        cols_A = len(A[0])
        cols_B = len(B[0])
        
        result = [[0] * cols_B for i in range(rows_A)]
        
        for i in range(rows_A):
            for j in range(cols_B):
                for k in range(cols_A):
                    result[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j]
        
        return result
