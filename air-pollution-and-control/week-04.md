Q5. On a highway, a lot of vehicles traveling daily release harmful chemical emissions. Consider the average emission rate from the vehicles of a pollutant P1 as 0.05 g/s. Determine the total chemical concentration of pollutant P1 at a point 600 m downwind from the highway on an overcast day. Let the wind be perpendicular to the highway with a speed of 5 m/s. The number of vehicles per unit length (in m) is 0.18 m.
