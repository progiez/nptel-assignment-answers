6\. Consider a binary relationship ExistsIn between entity types City and State. It records as to which city is located in what state. Suppose the cardinality ratio constraint of the this relationship is expressed using (min,max) notation as (u,v) on the line connecting City to ExistsIn and (x,y) on the line connecting State to ExistsIn, which one of the following is correct: (Assume that the capital of any state is a city).

- u,v) = (1,1); (x,y) = (0,N)
- (u,v) = (1,N); (x,y) = (1,1)
- (u,v) = (1,1); (x,y) = (1,N)
- (u,v) = (1,N); (x,y) = (0,N)
