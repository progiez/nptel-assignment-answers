**Q2. Humans easily get bored doing a repetitive job. However, computers are masters of iteration. In programming, we get a control structure that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. It enables automating repetitive tasks by iterating through a block of code until a specific condition is met or for a defined number of times. What is this control structure called?**\
Variable\
Operator\
Loop\
Data Type
