**1. Let (L) be a context-free language. Then according to the pumping lemma for context-free languages, there exists an integer (p \geq 1) such that every string (w \in L) can be written as (w = uvwxy) satisfying the following conditions:**

1\) (|vx| \geq 1)

2\) (|vwx| \leq p)

Which of the following statements is correct?

**a)** (\forall n \geq 0, u v^n w x^n y \in L)\
**b)** (\exists n \geq 0, u v^n w x^n y \in L)\
**c)** (\forall n \geq 0, u v^n w x^n y^n \in L)\
**d)** (\exists n \geq 0, u v^n w^n x^n y \in L)
