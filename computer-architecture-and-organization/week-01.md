**Question 3.** **Consider a 32-bit machine where an instruction `SUB R3, VAR (R3 = R3 — Mem[VAR])` is stored at memory location 2000 (hexadecimal). The variable VAR is located at memory address 3004 (hex), and contains the value 0050 (hex). The initial value of register R3 is 00A0 (hex). How many memory accesses are required to execute this instruction (assuming instructions are stored in memory), and what will be the content of the Program Counter (PC) after the instruction is fetched? Each instruction is 32 bits wide.**\
a) 1, 2004\
b) 2, 2004\
c) 1, 2002\
d) 2, 3004

**Question 4.** **Consider a 32-bit machine where an instruction `SUB R4,R5` is stored at memory location 300C (in hexadecimal). What will be the value of MAR, MDR, IR, and PC during the execution of the instruction? Assume each instruction is 32 bits wide.**\
a) MAR = 300C, MDR = SUB R4, R5, IR = SUB R4, R5, PC = 3010\
b) MAR = 300C, MDR = SUB R4, R5, IR = SUB R4, R5, PC = 300E\
c) MAR = 3010, MDR = SUB R4, R5, IR = SUB R4, R5, PC = 300C\
d) MAR = 3010, MDR = SUB R4, R5, IR = SUB R4, R5, PC = 300E

**Question 5.** **Consider the following three instructions stored in memory in consecutive memory locations:**

    MOV R4, R5
    AND R6, R4
    OR R6, R5

The first instruction is stored at memory location 9000 (in hexadecimal).

Assume the following initial register values:\
R4 = 00 (hex)\
R5 = 40 (hex)\
R6 = 3C (hex)

All instructions are 32 bits in size.

**What will be the final values of R4, R6, and PC after executing all the three instructions?**\
a) R4 = 00, R6 = 40, PC = 9008\
b) R4 = 40, R6 = 40, PC = 900D\
c) R4 = 40, R6 = 00, PC = 900C\
d) R4 = 3C, R6 = 01, PC = 900C
