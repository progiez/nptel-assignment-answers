1. \*\*A data scientist is using a Naive Bayes classifier to categorize emails as either “spam” or “not spam”. The features used for classification include:

- Number of recipients (To, Cc, Bcc)
- Presence of “spam” keywords (e.g., ”URGENT”, ”offer”, ”free”)
- Time of day the email was sent
- Length of the email in words

Which of the following scenarios, if true, is most likely to violate the key assumptions of Naive Bayes and potentially impact its performance?\*\*  
A) The length of the email follows a non-Gaussian distribution  
B) The time of day is discretized into categories (morning, afternoon, evening, night)  
C) The proportion of spam emails in the training data is lower than in real-world email traffic  
D) There’s a strong correlation between the presence of the word ”free” and the length of the email

1. \*\*Consider the two statements:  
Statement 1: Bayesian Networks are inherently structured as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

Which of these are true?\*\*  
A) Both the statements are True.  
B) Statement 1 is true, and statement 2 is false.  
C) Statement 1 is false, and statement 2 is true.
