1. **Which of these statements is/are True about Random Forests?**\
   a. The goal of random forests is to increase the correlation between the trees.\
   b. The goal of random forests is to decrease the correlation between the trees.\

4. **Consider the below dataset: Suppose you have to classify a test example “The ball won the race to the boundary” and are asked to compute P(Cricket | “The ball won the race to the boundary”), what is an issue that you will face if you are using Naive Bayes Classifier, and how will you work around it? Assume you are using word frequencies to estimate all the probabilities.**\
   a. There won’t be a problem, and the probability of P(Cricket | “The ball won the race to the boundary”) will be equal to 1.\
   b. Problem: A few words that appear at test time do not appear in the dataset. Solution: Smoothing.\
   c. Problem: A few words that appear at test time appear more than once in the dataset. Solution: Remove those words from the dataset.\
   d. None of these\

5. **A company hires you to look at their classification system for whether a given customer would potentially buy their product. When you check the existing classifier on different folds of the training set, you find that it manages a low accuracy of usually around 60%. Sometimes, it’s barely above 50%. With this information in mind, and without using additional classifiers, which of the following ensemble methods would you use to increase the classification accuracy effectively?**\
   a. Committee Machine\
   b. AdaBoost\

1. \*\*A data scientist is using a Naive Bayes classifier to categorize emails as either “spam” or “not spam”. The features used for classification include:

- Number of recipients (To, Cc, Bcc)
- Presence of “spam” keywords (e.g., ”URGENT”, ”offer”, ”free”)
- Time of day the email was sent
- Length of the email in words

Which of the following scenarios, if true, is most likely to violate the key assumptions of Naive Bayes and potentially impact its performance?\*\*  
A) The length of the email follows a non-Gaussian distribution  
B) The time of day is discretized into categories (morning, afternoon, evening, night)  
C) The proportion of spam emails in the training data is lower than in real-world email traffic  
D) There’s a strong correlation between the presence of the word ”free” and the length of the email
