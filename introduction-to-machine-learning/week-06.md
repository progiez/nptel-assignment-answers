**3. Having built a decision tree, we are using reduced error pruning to reduce the size of the tree. We select a node to collapse. For this particular node, on the left branch, there are three training data points with the following outputs: 5, 7, 9.6, and for the right branch, there are four training data points with the following outputs: 8.7, 9.8, 10.5, 11. The average value of the outputs of data points denotes the response of a branch. The original responses for data points along the two branches (left & right respectively) were response−left and response−right and the new response after collapsing the node is response−new. What are the values for response−left, response−right, and response−new (numbers in the option are given in the same order)?**

A) 9.6, 11, 10.4  
B) 7.2; 10; 8.8  
C) 5, 10.5, 15  
D) Depends on the tree height
