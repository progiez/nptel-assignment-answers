**4) Let us consider a Convolutional Neural Network having three different convolutional layers in its architecture as:**

- **Layer-1:** Filter Size 3 × 3, Number of Filters 10, Stride 1, Padding 0
- **Layer-2:** Filter Size 5 × 5, Number of Filters 20, Stride 2, Padding 0
- **Layer-3:** Filter Size 5 × 5, Number of Filters 40, Stride 2, Padding 0

Layer 3 of the above network is followed by a fully connected layer. If we give a 3D image input of dimension 39 × 39 to the network, then which of the following is the input dimension of the fully connected layer?

**6) Consider a CNN model which aims at classifying an image as either a rose, a marigold, a lily, or an orchid (consider the test image can have only one of the classes at a time). The last (fully-connected) layer of the CNN outputs a vector of logits, L, that is passed through an activation function that transforms the logits into probabilities, P. These probabilities are the model predictions for each of the 4 classes. Fill in the blanks with the appropriate option.**

a) Leaky ReLU\
b) Tanh\
c) ReLU\
d) Softmax
