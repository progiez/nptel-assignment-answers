Q3. The betweenness centrality of a node v in a graph G is calculated by:

a) ∑i≠jσij(v)/σij, where σij is the total number of shortest paths between i and j, and σij(v) is the number of those paths passing through v.\
b) The ratio of the node’s degree to the total number of edges.\
c) The clustering coefficient of the node.\
d) The sum of weights of edges connected to v.

Q4. In graph partitioning, the modularity measure is used to evaluate:

a) The density of a node’s local neighborhood.\
b) The quality of a partition based on the ratio of intra-cluster and inter-cluster edges.\
c) The average degree of nodes in a graph.\
d) The overall size of the graph.

Q5. In a social network graph, strong relationships can be identified using:

a) Nodes with the highest degree centrality.\
b) Nodes connected by edges with high weights representing frequent interactions.\
c) Nodes with low clustering coefficients.\
d) Nodes that are part of disjoint communities.

Q6. Weak relationships are considered essential in network analysis because:

a) They reduce the clustering coefficient of the network.\
b) They enable diffusion of novel information between clusters.\
c) They increase the density of the graph.\
d) They are more stable than strong ties.

Q7. The homophily index measures the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others. It is mathematically represented as:

a) H = Number of similar connections / Total connections\
b) H = Clustering coefficient / Degree centrality\
c) H = Betweenness centrality × Degree centrality\
d) H = Number of inter-group connections / Total connections

Q9. Foci closure in social networks is strongly tied to:

a) Shared affiliation to activities or spaces that increase the likelihood of interaction\
b) Strong ties that persist despite geographic separation.\

b) Randomized connections that optimize modularity.\
c) Shortest path distribution across clusters.\
