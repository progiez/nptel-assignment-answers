**Which of the following correctly interprets the structure and properties of the graph described by the GML code?**\
(a) The graph is undirected, with two nodes labeled “A” and “B” connected by two edges with weights 5 and 3, respectively.\
(b) The graph is directed, with node “A” pointing to node “B” with a weight of 5, and node “B” pointing back to node “A” with a weight of 3.\
(c) The graph is directed, with node “A” pointing to node “B” with a weight of 3, and node “B” pointing to node “A” with a weight of 5.\
(d) The graph is directed and contains a self-loop at node “A” with a weight of 5, and another self-loop at node “B” with a weight of 3.

**5. Consider the following characteristics of different social network dataset formats. Which of the following statements is true about these formats?**\
(a) Adjacency Matrix is most efficient for storing sparse graphs because it requires minimal space for large graphs with few edges.\
(b) Edge List format is not ideal for storing sparse graphs as it does not require extra space to store non-existing edges between nodes.\
(c) Adjacency List is space-efficient for sparse graphs and allows for fast traversal of neighbors, making it suitable for networks with relatively few edges compared to nodes.\
(d) Gephi File format is designed for large-scale networks and is not ideal for visualizing or analyzing graphs with edge weights or node attributes.
