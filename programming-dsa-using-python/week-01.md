    def f(n):
        s = 0
        for i in range(2,n):
            if n%i == 0 and i%2 == 1:

**Question 3.** Consider the following function h.

    def h(n):
        s = True
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i*i == n:
                s = False
        return(s)

The function h(n) given above returns False for a positive number n if and only if:

a) n is an odd number.\
b) n is a prime number.\
c) n is a perfect square.\
d) n is a composite number.
