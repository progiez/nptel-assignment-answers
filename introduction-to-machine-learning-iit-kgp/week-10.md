**3. In BIRCH, using number of points NN, sum of points SUMSUM, and sum of squared points SSSS, we can determine the centroid and radius of the combination of any two clusters A and B. How do you determine the radius of the combined cluster?**

a. Radius=SSANA−(SUMANA)2+SSBNB−(SUMBNB)2Radius = \sqrt{ \frac{SS\_A}{N\_A} – \left(\frac{SUM\_A}{N\_A}\right)^2 + \frac{SS\_B}{N\_B} – \left(\frac{SUM\_B}{N\_B}\right)^2 }\
b. Radius=SSANA−(SUMANA)2+SSBNB−(SUMBNB)2Radius = \sqrt{ \frac{SS\_A}{N\_A} – \left(\frac{SUM\_A}{N\_A}\right)^2 } + \sqrt{ \frac{SS\_B}{N\_B} – \left(\frac{SUM\_B}{N\_B}\right)^2 }\
c. Radius=SSA+SSBNA+NB−(SUMA+SUMBNA+NB)2Radius = \sqrt{ \frac{SS\_A + SS\_B}{N\_A + N\_B} – \left(\frac{SUM\_A + SUM\_B}{N\_A + N\_B}\right)^2 }\
d. Radius=SSANA+SSBNB−(SUMA+SUMBNA+NB)2Radius = \sqrt{ \frac{SS\_A}{N\_A} + \frac{SS\_B}{N\_B} – \left(\frac{SUM\_A + SUM\_B}{N\_A + N\_B}\right)^2 }

**4. Statement 1: CURE is robust to outliers.\
Statement 2: Because of multiplicative shrinkage, the effect of outliers is dampened.**

a. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 2 is the correct reason for statement 1.\
b. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is true. Statement 2 is not the correct reason for statement 1.\
c. Statement 1 is true. Statement 2 is false.\
d. Both statements are false.
