**Question 9. The concept of Roll, Pitch and Yaw angles has been used to represent the rotation of a frame (B) with respect to the reference frame (U). Let us suppose that the above rotation can also be expressed by a 3 x 3 rotation matrix, as given below.** \[10000.50.86600.8660.5]\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0.5 & 0.866 \\\ 0 & 0.866 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}

The angles of rolling (α), pitching (β) and yawing (γ) are found to be as follows:\
a) α = 45°, β = 60°, γ = 0°\
b) α = 0°, β = 60°, γ = 45°\
c) α = 0°, β = 30°, γ = 45°\
d) α = 60°, β = 0°, γ = 0°

**Question 10. The concept of Euler angles has been used to represent the rotation of a frame (B) with respect to the reference frame (U). Let us suppose that the above rotation can also be expressed by a 3 x 3 rotation matrix as given below.** \[0.86600.50100.500.866]\begin{bmatrix} 0.866 & 0 & 0.5 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.866 \end{bmatrix}

The Euler angles (α, β, γ) are found to be as follows:\
a) α = 0°, β = 30°, γ = 0°\
b) α = 45°, β = 0°, γ = 60°\
c) α = 30°, β = 30°, γ = 30°\
d) α = 45°, β = 45°, γ = 45°
