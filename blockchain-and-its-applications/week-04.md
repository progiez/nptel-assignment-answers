Q2. Suppose a miner initially receives 100 bitcoins as a reward for successfully mining a block at time Jan 2009.\
The reward for mining a block is halved approximately every four years (or after every 210,000 blocks).\
Based on this halving process, which of the following statements are correct?

a) In Jan 2013, the miner will receive 50 bitcoins for adding a new block.\
b) In Jan 2018, the miner will receive 25 bitcoins for adding a new block.\
c) In Jan 2021, the miner will receive 12.5 bitcoins for adding a new block.\
d) In Jan 2024, the miner will receive 6.25 bitcoins for adding a new block.

Q3. How does the Bitcoin network prevent double spending?

a) A centralized authority will be used to verify each transaction before it is added to the blockchain.\
b) Relying on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism ensures that only one valid transaction is accepted.\
c) All transactions are stored in a centralized database that tracks each Bitcoin’s status.\
d) By limiting Bitcoin transactions to one per user per day.

[****See also**  **Blockchain and its Applications | Week 10****](https://progiez.com/blockchain-and-its-applications-assignment-10-answers)

a) To validate transactions with the need for a central authority.\
b) To speed up transaction processing times by reducing the time needed to add new blocks.\
c) To make it easier for miners to add new blocks without computational work.\
d) To secure the network and prevent fraudulent transactions through computational difficulty.

Q10. Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding Proof of Work (PoW) in the context of forks, attacks, and the monopoly problem?

a) PoW forks can occur when two miners independently solve the puzzle at the same time, leading to a brief divergence in the blockchain.\
b) While PoW encourages miners to follow the longest chain, it does not prevent attacks like 51% attacks, where malicious miners can control the blockchain.\
c) The Monopoly Problem refers to a situation where a single miner or group controls a majority of the network’s hashing power, undermining decentralization.\
d) Proof of Work ensures complete decentralization by preventing any miner from controlling the majority of the hashing power.
