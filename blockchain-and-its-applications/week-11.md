**6. A blockchain network has a 10-minute block interval. A miner, “Miner X,” controls 40% of the network’s hashing power. Miner X mines a block and does not broadcast it immediately. Instead, Miner X continues mining a second block in secret. What is the most likely result of Miner X’s actions in this scenario?**

a) Miner X’s second block will automatically become part of the blockchain, and the first block will always be discarded.\
b) Miner X’s second block will possibly create a fork in the blockchain, which will later be resolved through a chain reorganization.\
c) Miner X will always successfully steal the rewards of other miners on the network.\
d) Miner X’s actions must cause the network to collapse due to an attack.
