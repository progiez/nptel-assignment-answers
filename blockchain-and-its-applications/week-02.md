**Q2. Bob wishes to send a lengthy message to Alice with the requirement that Alice can verify its origin and Bob cannot later disown the message. They also want to ensure the confidentiality of the message. Alice and Bob decide to employ public key cryptography and cryptographic hashing techniques. Let the key pairs for Alice and Bob be (Pub A, Pri A) and (Pub B, Pri B) respectively, and let E, D, and H denote the encryption, decryption, and hash functions respectively. M represents the message, and H(M) is its digest. Which of the following outlines the correct sequence of steps for Alice to send the digitally signed message?**

**i. At Bob: M’ = E(M, K\_pubA)\
ii. At Alice: M = E(M’, K\_priA)\
iii. Bob sends the message M’ to Alice\
iv. The signature along with the message is sent to Alice (M, M’)\
v. Bob: M’ = E(M, К\_рів)\
vi. Signing the message with his private key: S = E(H(M), К\_рів)\
vii. M = Е(М’, К\_рubв)**\
a. v, vii, ii, i, iii, iv, vi\
b. i, iii, ii, v, iv, vii, vi\
c. i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii\
d. vii, vi, v, iv, iii, ii, i

**Answer: b. i, iii, ii, v, iv, vii, vi**
