**4. Which of the following statements accurately describes the differences between arrays and linked lists?**

A) Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, are static data structures, and are generally faster for random access. Linked lists store elements in non-contiguous memory locations, are dynamic data structures, and are better for operations like insertion and deletion.\
B) Arrays and linked lists both store elements in contiguous memory locations but differ in that arrays are dynamic while linked lists are static.\
C) Arrays and linked lists are both dynamic data structures and store elements in non-contiguous memory locations, but arrays are faster for insertion and deletion operations.\
D) Arrays are dynamic and store elements in non-contiguous memory locations, while linked lists are static and store elements in contiguous memory locations.
