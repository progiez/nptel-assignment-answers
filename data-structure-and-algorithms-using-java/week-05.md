**2. Which of the following statements about the implementation of a stack using an array in Java is true?**

**a)** The stack implemented using an array in Java can automatically resize itself when it becomes full.\
**b)** You need to manually resize the array when the stack implemented using an array in Java becomes full.\
**c)** The stack implemented using an array in Java provides constant time (O(1)) complexity for push and pop operations regardless of the number of elements.\
**d)** Arrays in Java are dynamically resizable and do not require manual resizing.

**3. Given the following Java code snippet, which involves a series of stack operations:**

    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(10);
    stack.push(20);
    stack.push(30);
    stack.pop();
    stack.push(40);
    stack.push(50);
    stack.pop();
    stack.pop();
    stack.push(60);
    stack.push(70);
    stack.pop();

**What is the sequence of elements in the stack from top to bottom after all operations have been performed?**

**a)** 10, 20, 60\
**b)** 20, 10, 60\
**c)** 60, 20, 10\
**d)** 60, 10, 20

**5. What will be the output of the following main method?**

    import java.util.Stack;

<!---->

    public class Test {
        public static String test1(String input) {
            Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
            for (char ch : input.toCharArray()) {
                stack.push(ch);
            }
            return test2(stack);
        }    private static String test2(Stack<Character> stack) {
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return "";
            } else {
                char ch = stack.pop();
                return ch + test2(stack);
            }
        }    public static void main(String[] args) {
            String input = "exam";
            System.out.println(test1(input)); // What is the output?
        }
    }

**a)** exam\
**b)** maxe\
**c)** e\
**d)** exammaxe

**6. Imagine you are developing a feature for a text editor that allows users to undo their last set of changes. You decide to use a stack to implement this feature. Each time a user makes a change, the previous state of the text is pushed onto the stack. When the user selects “Undo”, the most recent state is popped from the stack, and the text reverts to that state.**

Given the following sequence of text states:

1. “Hello”
2. “Hello World”
3. “Hello World!”
4. “Hello World!!!”

**If the user makes three consecutive “Undo” operations, what will be the current state of the text?**

**a)** “Hello World!!!”\
**b)** “Hello World”\
**c)** “Hello”\
**d)** “”

**a)** Push all elements onto the stack and then pop them back into the array.\
**b)** Pop elements from the array and push them onto the stack.\
**c)** Iterate through the array and swap elements from the beginning with elements from the end.\
**d)** Create a new array and copy elements from the original array in reverse order.
