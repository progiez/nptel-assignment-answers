# Assignment

**Question 1\
Write a C program to check whether a given number (N) is a perfect number or not.\
\[Perfect Number — A perfect number is a positive integer number which is equals to the sum of its proper positive divisors. For example 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and it’s sum is equals to 6.]**

**Solution:**

    int sum=0;
    	for(int i = 1; i <= N / 2; i++)
        {
            if(N % i == 0)
            {
                sum += i;
            }
        }

<!---->

        if(sum == N){
            printf("%d is a perfect number.", N);
        }
    	else{
            printf("%d is not a perfect number.", N);
        }
        return 0;
    }

**Question 2\
Write a C program to count total number of digits of an Integer number (N).**

**Solution:**

    int temp, count;
        count=0;
        temp=N;
        while(temp>0)
        {
         	count++;
         	temp/=10;
        }
        printf("The number %d contains %d digits.",N,count);
    }

**Question 3\
Write a C program to check whether the given number(N) can be expressed as Power of Two (2) or not.\
For example 8 can be expressed as 2³.**

**Solution:**

    int temp, flag;
        temp=N;
        flag=0;

<!---->

        while(temp!=1)
        {
            if(temp%2!=0){
                flag=1;
                break;
            }
            temp=temp/2;
        }    if(flag==0)
            printf("%d is a number that can be expressed as power of 2.",N);
        else
            printf("%d cannot be expressed as power of 2.",N);
    }

**Question 4\
Write a C program to find sum of following series where the value of N is taken as input\
1+ 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + .. 1/N**

**Solution:**

    int i;
        for(i=1;i<=N;i++)
        {
          	sum = sum + ((float)1/(float)i);
        }
        printf("Sum of the series is: %.2f",sum);
    }
