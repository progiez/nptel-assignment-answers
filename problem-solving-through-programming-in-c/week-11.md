**10) Consider the following recursive C function that takes two arguments:**

    unsigned int func(unsigned int n, unsigned int r) {
        if (n > 0) 
            return (n % r + func(n / r, r));
        else 
            return 0;
    }

What is the return value of the function `func()` when it is called as `func(513, 2)`?
