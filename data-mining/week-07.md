8. **Consider a set of five 2-dimensional points p1=(0, 0), p2=(0, 1), p3=(5, 8), p4=(5, 7), and p5=(0, 0.5). Euclidean distance is the distance function. Single linkage clustering is used to cluster the points into two clusters. The clusters are:**\
   a) {p1, p2, p3} {p4, p5}\
   b) {p1, p4, p5} {p2, p3}\
   c) {p1, p2, p5} {p3, p4}\
   d) {p1, p2, p4} {p3, p5}

9. **Which of the following is not true about K-means clustering algorithm?**\
   a) It is a partitional clustering algorithm\
   b) The final cluster obtained depends on the choice of initial cluster centres\
   c) Number of clusters need to be specified in advance\
   d) It can generate non-convex cluster shapes

10. **Consider a set of five 2-dimensional points p1=(0, 0), p2=(0, 1), p3=(5, 8), p4=(5, 7), and p5=(0, 0.5). Euclidean distance is the distance function. The k-means algorithm is used to cluster the points into two clusters. The initial cluster centers are p1 and p4. The clusters after two iterations of k-means are:**\
    a) {p1, p4, p5} {p2, p3}\
    b) {p1, p2, p5} {p3, p4}\
    c) {p3, p4, p5} {p1, p2}\
    d) {p1, p2, p4} {p3, p5}
