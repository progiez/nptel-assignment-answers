**4) Choose the correct items for X, and Y.**

The Map phase is subdivided into M pieces and the reduce phase into R pieces. There are practical bounds on how large M and R can be since the master must make X scheduling decisions and keeps Y state in memory.

a. X: O(M + R), Y: O(M \* R)\
b. X: O(M \* R), Y: O(M \* R)\
c. X: O(M + R), Y: O(M + R)\
d. X: O(M \* R), Y: O(M + R)
