Q3. A client gets a timestamp of 3:12:30.500 from a time server. The elapsed time between the request and response was 20 msec (0.020 sec). The current time on the client is 3:12:30.510. Using Cristian’s algorithm i.e. server time + ½(elapsed time), what is the time set on the client?

(a) 3:12:30.480\
(b) 3:12:30.490\
(c) 3:12:30.510\
(d) 3:12:30.520

Q4. A client’s clock reads 3:20:00. The server’s clock reads 3:10:00 when they synchronize using the Berkeley algorithm. Assume message delays are negligible. What is the time at the client after synchronization?

(a) 3:20:00\
(b) 3:10:00\
(c) 6:30:00\
(d) 3:15:00
