5. **Find out the correct model for the given assumptions of a system:**

   - **Assumption 1**: Each message is received within bounded time.
   - **Assumption 2**: Drift of each process’ local clock has a known bound.
   - **Assumption 3**: Each step in a process takes lb\<time\<ublb < time < ub, where lblb represents the lower bound and ubub represents an upper bound.

   a. Asynchronous distributed system\
   b. Synchronous distributed system\
   c. On-demand computing system\
   d. Parallel processing system
