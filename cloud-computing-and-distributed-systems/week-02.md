1\. What are the two key design goals for Open vSwitch ?

- Scalability and partitioning
- Isolation and tunneling
- Reliability and filtering
- Flexible and fast-forwarding

[View Answer](https://my.progiez.com/courses/cloud-computing-and-distributed-systems/)

***

2\. Consider the following statements related to Software-defined networking (SDN) technology:

**Statement 1:** SDN is an approach to network management that enables dynamic, programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring making it more like cloud computing than traditional network management.

**Statement 2:** SDN attempts to centralize network intelligence in one network component by disassociating the forwarding process of network packets (data plane) from the routing process (control plane).

- Only statement 1 is true
- Only statement 2 is true
- Both statements are false
- Both statements are true

IV. Location independent addressing

Options:

- I, II, III
- I, II, IV
- II, III, IV
- I, III, IV

8\. Consider the following statements:

**Statement 1:** In Single-root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), forwarding is no longer as flexible because it relies on a layer two switch that is built into the hardware of the NIC.

**Statement 2:** In Single-root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), the live VM migration becomes trickier, because the virtual machine is tied to physical resources of the machine.

- Only statement 1 is true
- Only statement 2 is true
- Both statements are true
- Both statements are false

9\. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**_**\_\_**_** is the original OpenFlow controller. It serves as a network control platform, that provides a high level programmatic interface for management and the development of network control applications. Its system-wide abstractions turn networking into a software problem.

- Routing Control Platform
- 4D architecture
- Ethane
- NOX

10\. Choose the correct items for X, Y, and Z.

**X architecture comprises a hierarchy of controllers. At the top level we have the Y, which is talking to an SDN gateway. The gateway can be thought of as a super controller that talks to the controller’s at all these different Z.**

- X: Global controller, Y: Google’s B4, Z: Data center sites
- X: Google’s B4, Y: Data center sites, Z: Global controller
- X: Google’s B4, Y: Global controller, Z: Data center sites
- X: Data center sites, Y: Google’s B4, Z: Global controller
