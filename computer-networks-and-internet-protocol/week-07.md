1. **Which of the following statements about delay components in a network is false?**\
   a) Propagation delay depends on the length of the transmission link.\
   b) Queuing delay increases when incoming data exceeds the processing rate of a router.\
   c) Transmission delay is influenced by the packet size and the bandwidth of the channel.\
   d) Transmission delay is typically greater than queuing delay in congested networks.

2. **How does traffic shaping differ from traffic policing in the context of QoS?**\
   a) Traffic shaping identifies and marks packets for prioritization, while traffic policing drops packets that violate QoS.\
   b) Traffic shaping regulates outgoing traffic rates, while traffic policing monitors and drops packets violating QoS.\
   c) Traffic shaping prioritizes real-time traffic, while traffic policing prioritizes non-real-time traffic.\
   d) Traffic shaping is applied only at the router, while traffic policing is applied only at the source.

3. **Which of the following statements about the token bucket algorithm are correct?**\
   S1: It allows burst traffic by using accumulated tokens.\
   S2: It discards excess tokens when the bucket is full.\
   S3: It smooths out traffic to a constant rate by dropping excess packets.\
   S4: It allows traffic to exceed the token generation rate temporarily if tokens are available.

a) S1 and S3 only\
b) S2 and S4 only\
c) S1, S2 and S4 only\
d) S2, S3 and S4 only

4. **A video streaming service uses a token bucket with a token generation rate of 5 Mbps and a bucket size of 10 MB. If the stream has a sudden burst requiring 20 MB of data, how much data can be transmitted immediately without exceeding the allowed rate?**\
   a) 10 MB\
   b) 25 MB\
   c) 20 MB\
   d) 5 MB

5. **During peak traffic, a network’s RED mechanism begins dropping packets when the average queue size reaches the maximum threshold. Why is this early packet drop strategy crucial for maintaining QoS?**\
   a) It reduces packet loss for inelastic traffic by halting elastic traffic completely.\
   b) It triggers congestion control in TCP before queue overflow occurs.\
   c) It ensures low-priority traffic is always prioritized over high-priority traffic.\
   d) It guarantees that all packets from elastic traffic are evenly distributed.

6. **What is the primary role of a bandwidth broker in the DiffServ architecture?**\

   b) Reserve resources in all routers within a domain.\
   c) Facilitate inter-domain QoS agreements.\
   d) Manage traffic shaping at edge routers.
