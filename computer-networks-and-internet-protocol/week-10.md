**3) In Go-Back-N ARQ, why must the size of the sender’s window be less than 2m, where m is the number of bits in the sequence number?**

a) To prevent out-of-order frames from being accepted by the receiver\
b) To allow cumulative acknowledgments to function correctly\
c) To ensure the receiver’s window size can accommodate all pending frames\
d) To avoid ambiguities in the sequence numbers during retransmission

**10) A network administrator is analyzing a collision on a traditional Ethernet network using CSMA/CD. They observe the following sequence:**

(i) A node transmits a frame after sensing the medium is free.\
(ii) A collision occurs, detected by voltage fluctuations.\
(iii) A jam signal is transmitted, and the node applies a backoff algorithm.

If the backoff limit is reached without successful transmission, what should the node do next?

a) Retry immediately without further sensing\
b) Send another jam signal and continue to back off indefinitely\
c) Abort the transmission and report a failure\
d) Switch to a synchronous MAC protocol
