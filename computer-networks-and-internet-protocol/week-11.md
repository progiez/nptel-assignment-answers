**7) Given a wireless network using CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance), where the transmission time of a data frame is 200 ms. The contention window backoff time (in the event of a collision) always follows an exponential backoff mechanism, with a random backoff time selected from a range of 0 to 10 slots. Each slot is 10 ms. A collision happens, and the backoff time for retransmission is selected randomly within the range of 0 to 10 slots. What is the total time spent (in ms) for the first retransmission if the backoff time is randomly selected to be 7 slots? (Ignore the time spent in the first transmission attempt)**

a) 200 ms\
b) 250 ms\
c) 260 ms\
d) 270 ms
