Data Description:**An automotive service chain is launching its new grand service station this weekend.They offer to service a wide variety of cars. The current capacity of the station is to check 315 cars thoroughly per day. As an inaugural offer, they claim to freely check all cars that arrive on their launch day, and report whether they need servicing or not!\
Unexpectedly, they get 450 cars. The servicemen will not work longer than the working hours, but the data analysts have to!

Can you save the day for the new service station?\
How can a data scientist save the day for them?\
He has been given a data set, ‘ServiceTrain.csv’ that contains some attributes of the car that can be easily measured and a conclusion that if a service is needed or not.\
Now for the cars they cannot check in detail, they measure those attributes and store them in ‘ [ServiceTest.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RGrJC55RXuK2Z7TBO6vGuOYSWnclZ2ZI/view?usp=sharing) ’\
