Which option has the correct Gini indices for the child nodes?

a) Gini index for Node 1: 0.500, Gini index for Node 2: 0.428\
b) Gini index for Node 1: 0.375, Gini index for Node 2: 0.370\
c) Gini index for Node 1: 0.400, Gini index for Node 2: 0.375\
d) Gini index for Node 1: 0.400, Gini index for Node 2: 0.500
