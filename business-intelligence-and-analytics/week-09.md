a. K-medoids algorithm uses actual data points as cluster representatives, while K-modes algorithm employs modes to assess similarity in categorical data.\
b. K-means algorithm calculates the mean of points within a cluster to determine the centroid, while K-modes algorithm utilizes modes to evaluate similarity in categorical data.\
c. K-medoids algorithm is generally more robust to outliers and noise compared to K-means algorithm.\
d. The K-means algorithm always produces better results than K-medoids for all types of datasets.

**2) Which of the following statements is true about the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method?**

a. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering follows a top-down approach, starting with all objects in one cluster and splitting them iteratively.\
b. In agglomerative hierarchical clustering, each data point starts as an individual cluster, and clusters are merged iteratively.\
c. The merging process in agglomerative clustering is random and does not depend on distance measures.\
d. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering requires exactly 𝑛 + 1 iterations to form the final clustering structure.
