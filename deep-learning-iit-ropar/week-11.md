**2) Suppose that we need to develop an RNN model for sentiment classification. The input to the model is a sentence composed of five words, and the output is the sentiment (positive or negative). Assume that each word is represented as a vector of length 100×1, and the output labels are one-hot encoded. Further, the state vector st is initialized with all zeros of size 30×1. How many parameters (including bias) are there in the network?**
