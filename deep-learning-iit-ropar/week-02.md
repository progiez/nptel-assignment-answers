**Q8.**We have a classification problem with labels 0 and 1. We train a logistic model and find out that ω0\
learned by our model is -17. We are to predict the label of a new test point x\
using this trained model. If ωTx=1, which of the following statements is True?

We cannot make any prediction as the value of ωTx\
does not make sense\
The label of the test point is 0.\
The label of the test point is 1.

We cannot make any prediction as we do not know the value of x.
