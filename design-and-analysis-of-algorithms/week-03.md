**Q2.** Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V,E) with V = {1,2,…,n} and E presented as an adjacency list. For each vertex u in V, L(u) is a list \[v1,v2,…,vk] such that (u,vi) in E for each i in {1,2,…,k}.

If we reverse the edges in G, we get a new graph GR = (V,ER) with the same set of vertices such that (u,v) in ER if and only if (v,u) in E.

We can represent GR using an adjacency list where, for each u in V, LR(u) is the list of neighbors of u with respect to ER.

Let n be the number of vertices in V and m be the number of edges in E. How long would it take to construct the adjacency lists LR(u), u in V, from the lists L(u), u in V?

A) O(m)\
B) O(n + m)\
C) O(n²)\
D) O(n² + m)

**Q5.** Assembling a laptop consists of several steps, such as fixing the motherboard, inserting the battery, putting in the keyboard, attaching the screen, etc. Suppose there are 10 steps, labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. Each step takes a day to complete and we have the following dependencies between steps.

- A must happen before H
- B must happen before F
- B must happen before G
- C must happen before H
- D must happen before E
- E must happen before B
- F must happen before A
- F must happen before C
- G must happen before F
- I must happen before D
- I must happen before G
- J must happen before D
- J must happen before I

What is the minimum number of days required to complete the interiors?

A) 9\
B) 8\
C) 7\
D) 6
