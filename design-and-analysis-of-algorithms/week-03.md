**Q2.** Suppose we have a directed graph G = (V,E) with V = {1,2,…,n} and E presented as an adjacency list. For each vertex u in V, L(u) is a list \[v1,v2,…,vk] such that (u,vi) in E for each i in {1,2,…,k}.

If we reverse the edges in G, we get a new graph GR = (V,ER) with the same set of vertices such that (u,v) in ER if and only if (v,u) in E.

We can represent GR using an adjacency list where, for each u in V, LR(u) is the list of neighbors of u with respect to ER.

Let n be the number of vertices in V and m be the number of edges in E. How long would it take to construct the adjacency lists LR(u), u in V, from the lists L(u), u in V?

A) O(m)\
B) O(n + m)\
C) O(n²)\
D) O(n² + m)
