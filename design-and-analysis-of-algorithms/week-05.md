5. Consider an alternative to binary search called ternary search that divides the input array into three equal parts and recursively searches one of these three segments. What can we say about the asymptotic worst-case complexity of ternary search versus binary search?\
   A. The complexity of ternary search is the same as that of binary search.\
   B. The complexity of binary search is strictly better than that of ternary search.\
   C. The complexity of ternary search is strictly better than that of binary search.\
   D. The relative complexity of ternary and binary search depends on the distribution of values across the array.\
