**Q1.** **Consider the following variation of the merge function**, where the input lists A and B are assumed to be sorted, with no duplicated elements, and C is the output list.\
What does C contain after executing `StrangeMerge(A, m, B, n, C)`?\
a) C contains the intersection of A and B.\
b) C contains all values in A that do not occur in B.\
c) C contains all values in B that do not occur in A.\
d) C contains all values that occur in either A or B, but not in both input lists.

**Q2.** **Suppose we modify mergesort as follows:** We split the input into three equal segments, recursively sort each segment, and then do a 3-way merge.\
What can we say about the **asymptotic worst-case complexity** of this 3-way mergesort compared to the usual mergesort?\
a) The asymptotic worst-case complexity of 3-way mergesort is the same as that of usual mergesort.\
b) The asymptotic worst-case complexity of 3-way mergesort is better than that of usual mergesort.\
c) The asymptotic worst-case complexity of 3-way mergesort is worse than that of usual mergesort.\
d) This depends on the length and the initial arrangement of values of the input.

1. **Having collected Aadhaar information for each SIM card, a government agency wants to check that all the Aadhaar numbers entered in SIM card applications are actually valid, by comparing SIM card applications against the list of registered Aadhaar numbers. Which of the following is likely to be the best strategy for this?**\
   a) Use a nested loop. For each SIM card application S, and for each Aadhaar number A, check if the Aadhaar number listed in S is the same as A.\
   b) Sort the SIM card applications and use binary search to speed up the process.\
   c) Sort the registered Aadhaar numbers and use binary search to speed up the process.\
   d) Sort both the SIM card applications and registered Aadhaar numbers and merge the two lists.
