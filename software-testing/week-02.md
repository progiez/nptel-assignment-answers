**Q1.When do we say that a test path p tours a sub-path q with a side-trip?**

A test path p tours a sub-path q with a side-trip when p is an infeasible test path on its own.

A test path p tours a sub-path q with a side-trip when every vertex and every edge in q also occurs in p\
in the same order.

A test path p tours a sub-path q with a side-trip when every vertex in q also occurs in p in the same order.

A test path p tours a sub-path q with a side-trip when every edge in qalso occurs in p in the same order.

**Q3.Why is complete path coverage considered to be an infeasible structural graph coverage criterion?**\
Complete path coverage could be infeasible if the graph has several disconnected components.\
Complete path coverage could be infeasible if the graph has strongly connected components or loops.\
Complete path coverage could be infeasible if the graph has isolated vertices or edges.\
Complete path coverage could be infeasible as covering all paths in a graph through test cases is not needed.
