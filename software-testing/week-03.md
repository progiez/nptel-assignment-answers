**Q3.**Given a piece of source code, what is the information about the data that is captured in a data flow graph corresponding the code?\
A data flow graph tracks information about how a value of a variable changes.\
A data flow graph captures information about how a variable gets defined, in the sense, the kind of statement that defines a variable.\

**Q5.**Considering the coverage criteria on both control flow graphs and data flow graphs, which of the following represents a correct order of subsumption amongst the mentioned criteria? Again, read →\
as ‘subsumes’.

Prime paths coverage →All-du-paths coverage.

All-du-paths coverage →Prime paths coverage.\
Since one kind of criteria are on control flow only and the other on data flow only, the two cannot be compared.\
None of the control flow coverage criteria subsumes any of the data flow coverage criteria.
