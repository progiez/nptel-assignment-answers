**Q2.**A node or a set of nodes that in a particular control flow graph that cannot be reached through DFS or BFS represents which kind of statements in the corresponding program source code?\
These node(s) represent statements that are incorrect.\
These node(s) represent statements that are not reachable by any input.\
These node(s) represent statements that are reachable only by inputs that are wrong or out of range.\
These node(s) represent statements that will not contribute to generating outputs when the program is executed.

**Q3.**Given a piece of source code, what is the information about the data that is captured in a data flow graph corresponding the code?\
A data flow graph tracks information about how a value of a variable changes.\
A data flow graph captures information about how a variable gets defined, in the sense, the kind of statement that defines a variable.\
A data flow graph captures information about the statements that define a value for a variable and statements that use the defined value of a variable.\
A data flow graph tracks the change of data from the statements where the variables are defined to the statements where the variables are used.

**Q4.**Which of the following represents a correct order of subsumption exclusively amongst data flow coverage criteria? In the options below, read →\
as ‘subsumes’.

All-defs coverage →All-du-paths coverage →All-uses coverage.

All-defs coverage →All-uses-coverage →All-du-paths coverage.

All-du-paths coverage →All-defs coverage →All-uses-coverage.

All-du-paths coverage →All-uses coverage →All-defs-coverage.

**Q5.**Considering the coverage criteria on both control flow graphs and data flow graphs, which of the following represents a correct order of subsumption amongst the mentioned criteria? Again, read →\
as ‘subsumes’.

Prime paths coverage →All-du-paths coverage.

All-du-paths coverage →Prime paths coverage.\
Since one kind of criteria are on control flow only and the other on data flow only, the two cannot be compared.\
None of the control flow coverage criteria subsumes any of the data flow coverage criteria.
