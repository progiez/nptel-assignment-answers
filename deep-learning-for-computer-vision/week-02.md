**Q2. Match the following:**\
1\) Gaussian filter i) Edges found when gradient is low\
2\) Sobel filter ii) Edges found at zero crossing\
3\) First derivative of Gaussian iii) Edge smoothing\
4\) Second derivative of Gaussian iv) Edge detection\
v) Edges found when gradient is high

1 → iii, 2 → iv, 3 →i, 4 →ii

1 →iii, 2 →i, 3 →ii, 4 →v

1 →iii, 2 →iv, 3 →v, 4 →ii

1 →iv, 2 →iii, 3 →i, 4 →ii

Q8.Which of the following statements is false?

Real-world RGB images can be thought of as matrices in continuous space on R3, but the images we store on a computer are discrete.

We can represent an RGB image as a function of the form. f:R3→R where R3\
represents image coordinates (channel, height, width) and R represents intensity.

The transformation I^(x,y)=I(x,−y) flip the image I upside down.\
Denoising an image through the moving average filter is an example of global operation as opposed to point or local operations.
