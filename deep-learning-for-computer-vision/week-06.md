**3. **Which of the following statements regarding the architectural design of ConvNEXT is incorrect?  
a) ConvNEXT employs depthwise convolutions followed by pointwise convolutions, similar to the MobileNet architecture, but with additional layer normalization and GELU activation.  
b) ConvNEXT replaces the traditional ResNet bottleneck block with a modified block that removes the ReLU activation function in favor of more non-linear operations like Swish.  
c) The ConvNEXT model increases the size of the convolutional kernels to 7×7 to better capture long-range dependencies, mimicking the self-attention mechanism in transformers.  
d) ConvNEXT introduces LayerNorm after the depthwise convolution and before the pointwise convolution to stabilize the training dynamics.
