**1. Which one of the following statements is true:**\
a) Weight change criterion is a method of ‘early stopping’ that checks whether or not the error is dropping over epochs to decide whether to continue training or stop.\
b) L2 norm tends to create more sparse weights than L1 norm.\
c) During the training phase, for each iteration, Dropout ignores a random fraction, p, of nodes, and accounts for it in the test phase by scaling down the activations by a factor of p.\
d) A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron is capable of modeling AND, OR, XOR, NOR, and NAND functions

**5. Consider the following statements P and Q regarding AlexNet and choose the correct option:**\
(P) In AlexNet, Response Normalization Layers were introduced to emulate the competitive nature of real neurons, where highly active neurons suppress the activity of neighboring neurons, creating competition among different kernel outputs.\
(Q) Convolutional layers contain only about 5% of the total parameters hence account for the least computation.

**Choose the correct option:**\
a) Only statement P is true\
b) Only statement Q is true\
c) Both statements are true\
d) None of the statements is true

**6. Given an input image of shape (10,10,3), you want to use one of the two following layers: Fully connected layer with 2 neurons, with biases Convolutional layer with three 2×2 filters (with biases) with 0 padding and a stride of 2. If you use the fully-connected layer, the input volume is “flattened” into a column vector before being fed into the layer. What is the difference in the number of trainable parameters between these two layers?**\
a) The fully connected layer has 566 fewer parameters\
b) The convolutional layer has 518 fewer parameters\
c) The convolutional layer has 570 fewer parameters\
d) None of the above

b) To get the output with the same size as that of the input, padding used is ⌊k/2⌋ where k×k is the kernel used.\
c) The number of feature maps obtained after a convolution operation depends on the depth of the input but not on the number of filters.\
